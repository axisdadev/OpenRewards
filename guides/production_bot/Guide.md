Authenticate with a multi factor security key or anything else as required. Once completed, your token should be ready to go on the page, Copy it where its marked.

![Bot permissions](<bot_permissions.png>)

Click on nessecary permissions as required, i recommend adding "Send Messages", "Embed Links", "Attach files", Add whatever else floats your boat. Do not turn on "ADMINSTRATOR", as it is not needed with the warning above. Besides that. Once completed, look below for the invite link and copy it.

![Invite Copy](<copy_invite.png>)
