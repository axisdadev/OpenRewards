# Configuring your configuration file.

> ðŸ‘‹ **Hi there!** In this tutorial. I will go over a brief explaination of the configuration file, what each one does & More! Without further ado. Lets get into it!

**Part 1**
Basic configuration part of the file.

```
TOKEN: "" # The bot token, retrive from https://discord.com/developers/applications
LOGGING: true # Enable basic logging for actions caused by the bot, user or more. Example: [LOG] Created profile for axisdadev (998819061817413652)
USER_DB: "data/users.json" # The name of the database used to store user data. Default = "data/users.json" 
STAFF_ROLES: [1270948998248927253] # The list of staff role ids that are able to give users points and currency. Example: [1260625936685076613, 1260646882741456949]
VERSION: "0.0.1 DEV" # Updated from github, touch if wanted. This doesnt affect much
```

The comments are already self explaintory, ``TOKEN`` is your bot's token, You can learn how to setup your bot for production in [This Guide](<https://github.com/axisdadev/OpenRewards/blob/main/guides/production_bot/Guide.md>)

> The ``LOGGING`` variable is either to enable or disable output logs in the python program. Example: [LOG] Created profile for axisdadev (998819061817413652) (Not recommended to disable!)

> The ```USER_DB`` variable is a string type, leading to where the data storing with TinyDB shall be located. This must be a .json file with the name "users"

> The ```STAFF_ROLES`` variable is a list with snowflake types, of the discord role ids. Developer mode must be enabled to get a role id. Learn how to enable it [here](<https://www.howtogeek.com/714348/how-to-enable-or-disable-developer-mode-on-discord/>), Right click on a users role or in the role management page to get them.

> The ```VERSION``` variable Is updated through github, this wont affect much if changed. feel free to do so!
